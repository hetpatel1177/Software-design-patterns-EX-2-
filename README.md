# ðŸš€ Mars Rover Simulation

This project is a **console-based simulation** of a Mars Rover navigating a grid-based terrain.  
The rover can move forward, turn left, and turn right, while avoiding obstacles and staying inside the grid boundaries.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

- The rover starts at a given position `(x, y)` and direction (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`).
- Commands:
  - `M` â†’ Move forward
  - `L` â†’ Turn left
  - `R` â†’ Turn right
- The rover:
  - Must **not move outside** the grid
  - Must **stop when an obstacle is in the way**
- Status reports show the **current position, direction, and obstacle status**.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Pure **Object-Oriented Design**  
- Uses **Command Pattern** for commands (`M`, `L`, `R`)  
- No `if-else` chains â†’ relies on **polymorphism**  
- Supports obstacle placement  
- Grid boundaries enforced  
- Final status report for roverâ€™s position and direction
